# Leetcode_30_days_May_challenge
#Day_1
This would be my first sincere  attempt at coding challenge.I vow to myself that everyday,I will dedicate myself for this challenge.Problem seems easy in the begining days but as days progress it would become more difficult.Today,the solution of problem came to my mind only by previous few practise at leet code and I think that as I delve myself more into coding,idea came to my mind on their own.At last,it looks promising for another day challenge..............Bye for day1
